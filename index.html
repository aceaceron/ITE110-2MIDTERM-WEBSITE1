            <p>Boracay Island is considered as one of the best islands in the world and in a country with over 7500 islands to boot, it seemed to have taken the spotlight and has set quite the standard. If you haven’t noticed yet, we, Filipinos have gotten used to comparing other beaches to this world-famous island that Patar Beach in Pangasinan has since been dubbed as the “Boracay Of The North” and other beautiful beaches have similar nicknames as well. Indeed, Boracay has set the bar high that even the famous beaches of El Nido and Coron of the world’s number one island, Palawan have only come to a close second. Throughout the years, none has truly challenged Boracay until there was Calaguas Island.</p>

            <p>Calaguas Island was once a hidden paradise known to only a few and the bravest of travelers. It is a backpackers’ haven and a mountaineers’ refuge. I was probably still naive and young when I first heard about it in 2009 coupled with rumors of how ethereal was its beauty. What caught my attention even more is that many people prefers this island over the more popular Boracay. I couldn’t help but ask why. It haunted me for several years until January of this year, I finally got my answer.</p>

            <h2>WHY I THINK CALAGUAS ISLAND IS BETTER THAN BORACAY</h2>
            <p>Boracay Island for the record still has the most beautiful beaches. Well, that’s according to me. But seriously! Where else in the Philippines will you see sands as fine as the ones in Boracay’s White Beach? Where else would you see water with the same shade of blue and as calm or as gorgeous as the ones on this island? If we are to say which is the “Most Beautiful” then I wouldn’t argue if someone would answer Boracay but I wouldn’t also rest my case about Calaguas having qualities that make it absolutely the better choice.</p>

            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Mahabang Buhangin has fine white sands, the closest thing to those of Boracay.</li>
                <li>The water in Mahabang Buhangin has a beautiful shade of blue and green and is so refreshing.</li>
                <li>The beach stretches to over 3KM of white powdery sands and pristine waters.</li>
                <li>The beach water stays clear and clean despite the season which means no “lumot” scare during the summer months.</li>
                <li>Mahabang Buhangin offers a more serene environment perfect for those looking for some peace and quiet.</li>
                <li>The island is hardly commercialized that only small, native open cottages stood near the beach instead of fancy hotels.</li>
                <li>It is less frequented by tourists and the beach is uncrowded.</li>
                <li>It is affordable and easy to get to.</li>
                <li>It offers a more stunning view atop one of its hills.</li>
                <li>More islands to explore if you would go on island hopping.</li>
                <li>Overall, the island is the ideal tropical paradise. The way Boracay was before it was ruined by widespread commercialism.</li>

            <h2>HOW TO GO TO CALAGUAS ISLAND</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Via Paracale</b> -  From Daet, ride another bus to Paracale (1hr ; P90). Once in Paracale, ride a tricycle going to the port (15 min ; P15). Charter a boat going to Mahabang Buhangin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Via Vinzons</b> - From Daet, ride another bus or jeep to Vinzons (15-20mins ; P15). Once in Vinzons, ride a tricycle going to the port (15 min ; P15). Charter a boat going to the island’s famed Mahabang Buhangin .
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Vinzons is the more popular of the two routes since it is much nearer and the travel time is less. However, boat costs are much cheaper in Paracale although travel time to the island is much longer.</p>

            <h2>PRECIOUS MOMENTS IN CALAGUAS</h2>
            <p>Once there was an island so beautiful people call it otherworldly, paradise, and anything dreamy that sings sweet lullabies to the ear. And once there was a girl who dreamed of seeing this paradise thoughts of running along the beach of crystal clear waters and sinking her feet along its white powdery sands haunted her for years. Then the time has finally come for the girl to fulfill her dreams that she created moments she will cherish for the rest of her days.</p>
