        <p>Boracay Island is considered as one of the best islands in the world and in a country with over 7500 islands to boot, it seemed to have taken the spotlight and has set quite the standard. If you haven’t noticed yet, we, Filipinos have gotten used to comparing other beaches to this world-famous island that Patar Beach in Pangasinan has since been dubbed as the “Boracay Of The North” and other beautiful beaches have similar nicknames as well. Indeed, Boracay has set the bar high that even the famous beaches of El Nido and Coron of the world’s number one island, Palawan have only come to a close second. Throughout the years, none has truly challenged Boracay until there was Calaguas Island.</p>

        <p>Calaguas Island was once a hidden paradise known to only a few and the bravest of travelers. It is a backpackers’ haven and a mountaineers’ refuge. I was probably still naive and young when I first heard about it in 2009 coupled with rumors of how ethereal was its beauty. What caught my attention even more is that many people prefers this island over the more popular Boracay. I couldn’t help but ask why. It haunted me for several years until January of this year, I finally got my answer.</p>
